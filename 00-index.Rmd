  * How to prepare reference data
    * `dput`, `.Rdata`/`.RDS`, `.png` (because it's lossless)
    * remember about `set.seed` when sampling some data (--> plotly task)
    * `system.file`
* How to test?
  * split big functionalities into separate test, e.g. 1st test connection to db, 2nd test function on prepared ref data from db
  * expect, expect, expect
  * code coverage
* 
* Test driven development
  * What is that?
  * When to use - examples
