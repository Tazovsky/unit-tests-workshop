# What is Test Driven Development (`TDD`)?

It is development technique where new feature starts with wirting unit tests, so development cycle is:

1. Write new unit tests (`tests/testthat/test_new_feature.R`)
2. Run all tests (including old ones) and make sure that new tests fail (`Ctrl+Shift+T` or `devtools::test()`)
3. Write feature code (`R/new_feature.R`) and verify whether tests pass (`Ctrl+Shift+T` or `devtools::test()`)
4. If tests pass, new feature's code met requirements and did not break any old features,
else new code must be improved (fix code in `R/new_feature.R`) and **cycle repeated** (start from `#1` again)

# Why/when to use?

This technique requires developer to understand feature's requirement and specification.

# Real life example(s)

* SpendWorx case: when we were moving data from `.csv` file to `PostgreSQL` database. 
We knew exactly what were the requirements, be we knew output data
* SpendWorx case: when refactoring code to fit Shiny modules - again we know what are requirements 
both from UI and server sides

# Why it is not often used in practice?

* Fast growing apps are usually focused on effect. In such apps some time we don't know exactly what are the requirements,
because important part of development process is research and testing best _made-to-measure_ solutions. 
* To much `TDD` makes our life harder. It may happen that we will have too many _high-level_, too detailed tests which
may mean that our test code will require as much maintenance as production code.
* Onbarding of new developers may cost more - especially when they are less experienced
