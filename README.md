# Unit tests workshop

This content regards unit testing- in particular in R programming language.

## Auxiliary repository:
  * Clone repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tazovsky/unit-tests-workshop
    ```
  * Install helper R package:
    ```r
    # from cloned repository root directory run:
    devtools::install("unitTestsWorkshopPackage/")
    ```

## Agenda

* Why do unit testing?
* Correct R package structure
* Exceptions
* Reference data
* Test Driven Development
* How to test?

## Start with **`00-index.Rmd`**

I recommend starting with file **`00-index.Rmd`**, because all content is interactive.
