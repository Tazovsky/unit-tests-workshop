# Why do unit testing?

1. Ensures implemented changes, improvements, fixes doen't break anything
  * Fixing specific feature may result in breaking some other functinality
2. Saves time and reduces costs
  * no need/reduced need for manual testing of code results
3. Makes refactoring much easier and faster and reduces risk
- sometimes some old feature needs to be redesigned and changind already working and tested code is risky,
but when unit test are written it's much easier because we know what to expect, e.g. sepcific outputs 
4. With unit test we get bonus: documentation :)
- "documentation", but not literally - what I mean is that when we look at unit tests code we can easily learn 
how some function or whole feature works, what input it accepts, what is the output and generally how it works
